# boot2root
This project aims to make us discover computer security within different fields, through several challenges to pass root on the given ISO

## Summary
This project is an introduction to system penetration.

## Introduction
After all this hard work, we'll have fun at last!</br>
This project serves as a base so we can understand how to proceed in order penetrate a system we can legally access.</br>
We'll use any existing method in order to really break this ISO.</br>
Evaluation will be limited, but the skill we'll show when exploiting this ISO will be significantly rewarding for us, way beyond our grade.

## Objectives
This project aims to make us discover computer security within different fields, through several easy challenges.</br>
The more or less complex methods we'll use will help us see computer systems differently.</br>
We'll encounter obstacles during this project, but letâ€™s be clear: we'll have to overcome these obstacles by ourself.</br>
We'll think as a group, but first and foremost, have fun!!!!
