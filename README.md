# boot2root
This project aims to make me discover computer security within different fields, through several challenges to pass root on the given ISO

## Summary
This project is an introduction to system penetration.

## Introduction
After all this hard work, I'll have fun at last!</br>
This project serves as a base so I can understand how to proceed in order penetrate a system I can legally access.</br>
I'll use any existing method in order to really break this ISO.</br>
Evaluation will be limited, but the skill I'll show when exploiting this ISO will be significantly rewarding for me, way beyond my grade.

## Objectives
This project aims to make me discover computer security within different fields, through several easy challenges.</br>
The more or less complex methods I'll use will help me see computer systems differently.</br>
I'll encounter obstacles during this project, but letâ€™s be clear: I'll have to overcome these obstacles by myself.</br>
I'll think as a group, but first and foremost, have fun!!!!
