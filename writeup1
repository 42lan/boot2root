# Install ISO

Change the default networking mode of VM from NAT to Bridge to have more interaction between host machine and VM.
In bridged networking mode, the default gateway of VM is home router.
So, after start, VM will get the IP address in the same network range.
```sh
┌──$ [~/42/2022/boot2root]
└─>  VBoxManage modifyvm "boot2root" --nic1 bridged
```

Run the VM.
```sh
┌──$ [~/42/2022/boot2root]
└─>  VBoxManage startvm "boot2root" --type headless
Waiting for VM "boot2root" to power on...
VM "boot2root" has been successfully started.
```

Find the subnet address and the mask on which actuall device is running.
```sh
┌──$ [~/42/2022/boot2root]
└─>  ifconfig en0
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	ether 4c:32:75:9a:8f:4f
	inet6 fe80::c8e:b7dd:85d9:5032%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0x7
	inet 192.168.0.13 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
	media: autoselect
	status: active
```

```
0xffffff00 -> 255.255.255.0
192.168.0.13 & 255.255.255.0 = 192.168.0.0/24
```

```sh

By finding the IP address of boot2root VM scan it by runnig default `nmap` command with `-O` option to enable OS detection
